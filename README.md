## Frameworks:

This project was developed using:
- [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
- [TypeScript 4.3.2](https://www.typescriptlang.org/),
- [Styled-components](https://styled-components.com/),
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/),
- [Enzyme](https://enzymejs.github.io/enzyme/),

## Why

I decided to challange my knowledge and get to learn more about React, Typescript learning also new tools in the process.
Styled-components, Jest and Enzyme are fairly new to me. 
Especially testing with Jest and Enzyme has been/is quite challangin mainly because I chose a React functional approach
